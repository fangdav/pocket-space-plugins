  This skill should be used when the user asks to "review comments", "process feedback",
  "what did people say about this doc", "address the comments on X", "review the notes
  left on this document", or needs to digest feedback and comments left by others on a
  .docx file and turn them into actionable editing guidance. Produces an .md file inside
  the topic's Research/ folder with structured advice on how to revise the document.

# Comment Reviewer

Read comments and feedback left by others on a .docx file, then produce an actionable .md guide with editing advice and directions to take. The output lives in the topic's `Research/` folder so it's preserved alongside the source material.

## When to Use

- A .docx deliverable has received comments, tracked changes, or marginal notes from reviewers
- The user wants a clear summary of what feedback was given and what to do about it
- Before revising a document — to plan edits rather than reacting comment by comment

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Identify the Document

Ask the user:
- Which .docx file has the comments?
- Who left the comments? (helps contextualize — e.g., feedback from legal vs. product has different weight)

Locate the .docx within its topic folder:
```
[Topic_of_Research]/
├── [Topic_of_Research].docx   ← This file
└── Research/
```

### Step 2: Extract All Comments

Read the .docx and extract every piece of feedback:
- **Margin comments** — Who wrote it, what section it's on, what it says
- **Tracked changes** — Insertions, deletions, formatting changes, who made them
- **Inline suggestions** — Text-level edits proposed by reviewers
- **General notes** — Any top-level or summary feedback (e.g., cover page notes, email context the user provides)

Present a raw list of all comments found and confirm with the user before proceeding.

### Step 3: Analyze and Categorize

Group feedback into categories:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **Factual corrections** | Wrong data, outdated claims, incorrect attributions |
| **Structural feedback** | Reorder sections, add/remove sections, change flow |
| **Tone & style** | Writing is too formal/informal, unclear, verbose |
| **Missing content** | Reviewer wants something added that isn't there |
| **Challenges & pushback** | Reviewer disagrees with a finding or conclusion |
| **Questions** | Reviewer is asking for clarification, not suggesting a change |
| **Minor edits** | Typos, grammar, formatting — low effort fixes |

For each comment, assess:
- **Priority:** High (blocks approval), Medium (should address), Low (nice to have)
- **Effort:** Quick fix vs. requires new research vs. requires rethinking
- **Consensus:** Do multiple reviewers agree, or is this one person's opinion?

### Step 4: Generate the Editing Guide

Produce an .md file with this structure:

```markdown
# Comment Review: [Document Name]

**Author:** [Name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Document reviewed:** [Hyperlink to the .docx file]
**Reviewers:** [Names of people who left comments]

## Summary

[3-5 sentences. How many comments total? What's the overall sentiment — minor
tweaks needed, major rework, or fundamental disagreement? What are the biggest
themes?]

## High Priority — Must Address

### [Issue title]
- **Reviewer:** [Name]
- **Section:** [Which part of the doc]
- **Comment:** [What they said, quoted or paraphrased]
- **Recommended action:** [Specific advice on what to change and how]
- **Research needed:** [Yes/No — if yes, what to look into]

### [Next issue]
[Same structure]

## Medium Priority — Should Address

[Same structure per issue]

## Low Priority — Nice to Have

[Same structure per issue]

## Questions to Resolve

[Comments that are questions, not directives. For each:]
- **Reviewer:** [Name]
- **Question:** [What they asked]
- **Suggested answer/approach:** [How to address it]

## Conflicting Feedback

[Where two reviewers disagree or give contradictory advice:]
- **Reviewer A says:** [X]
- **Reviewer B says:** [Y]
- **Recommended resolution:** [Which direction to take and why]

## Editing Checklist

- [ ] [Specific edit 1 — section, what to change]
- [ ] [Specific edit 2]
- [ ] [Specific edit 3]
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Re-run through reviewers after edits

## References

[Vancouver style — if any recommended actions require new sources]
[1] Author. Title. Source. Year. URL.
```

### Step 5: File Placement

Place the editing guide inside the topic's `Research/` folder:

```
[Topic_of_Research]/
├── [Topic_of_Research].docx
└── Research/
    ├── README.md
    ├── [Existing research files...]
    └── [Document_Name]_Comment_Review.md   ← This file goes here
```

- Name: `[Document_Name]_Comment_Review.md`
- If multiple rounds of review happen, append the date: `[Document_Name]_Comment_Review_2026-02-17.md`
- Update the `Research/README.md` to reflect the new file
- Follow author sign-off and naming conventions from contribution guidelines

### Step 6: Hyperlinks

1. **Link to the .docx** — The editing guide must hyperlink to the document it's reviewing (relative path up to the topic folder)
2. **Link to existing research** — If a recommended action references an existing .md file in `Research/`, hyperlink to it
3. **Link from .docx context** — If the user plans to revise, they can reference this editing guide from within the document

## Style

- **Actionable.** Every piece of feedback should end with a clear recommended action — not just "reviewer said X" but "do Y in response"
- **Prioritized.** High-priority items first. The user should be able to read just the top section and know what matters most.
- **Diplomatic.** Summarize feedback neutrally. Don't editorialize on whether a reviewer is right or wrong — present the feedback and recommend a path forward.
- **Specific.** Reference exact sections of the document. "Update the market size figure in Section 2.3" not "fix the numbers."
