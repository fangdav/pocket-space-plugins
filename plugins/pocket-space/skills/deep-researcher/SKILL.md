  This skill should be used when the user asks to "go deeper on X", "drill into this segment",
  "I want more detail on X", "deep dive into X", "expand on this section", "deep research
  into these segments", "research the top segments", or wants to take a segment from a broad
  research file and produce a longer, more detailed investigation. Typically follows the
  analyzer — takes the top-ranked segments and produces standalone deep-dive documents for each.

# Deep Researcher

Take a segment and produce a detailed, standalone deep-dive document. Typically follows the analyzer — drilling into the top-ranked options to build thorough, evidence-based cases for each.

## When to Use

- The analyzer has surfaced top-ranked options worth investigating further
- A research .md file exists with high-level segments that need more detail
- A topic needs more than a few bullets — it needs thorough, sourced analysis

## Relationship to Other Research Skills

The deep researcher can work standalone or as part of the research workflow:
- Typically follows **analyzer** — takes the top-ranked segments and investigates them in depth
- Typically preceded by **research-md-maker** — which established the broad landscape
- Feeds into **research-synthesizer** — deep dives become source material for the final .docx

Every deep-dive document must **hyperlink back to the parent research file and comparison matrix** (if they exist).

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Identify Source Files and Confirm Segments

1. Locate the parent research .md file in the shared drive
2. Check for a comparison matrix (`.md` or `.xlsx`) from the analyzer — if one exists, read the rankings to understand which segments scored highest
3. Present the available segments to the user and **confirm which segment(s) they want to deep-dive** before proceeding
4. Read the relevant segment(s) from the parent file to understand what's already been covered
5. Note the parent file path and comparison matrix path — both will be linked in the output

If no parent file exists, ask the user if they want to run research-md-maker first to establish the landscape, or proceed directly with the deep dive.

### Step 2: Scope the Deep Dive

For each selected segment, clarify:
- What specific questions should this deep dive answer?
- Any particular angle? (technical, financial, competitive, regulatory)
- How will this research be used? (decision-making, investor deck, product spec)

### Step 3: Research

Go deep. Unlike the broad research file, this is thorough:
- Search for primary sources: academic papers, whitepapers, official reports, company data
- Look for case studies, real-world examples, and precedents
- Find quantitative data: market sizes, growth rates, adoption numbers, financials
- Identify expert opinions and contrarian viewpoints
- Map the competitive or option landscape within this specific segment

### Step 4: Write the Deep-Dive Document

Structure:

```markdown
# [Segment Name] — Deep Dive

**Author:** [Name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Parent Research:** [Hyperlink to the parent research .md file]
**Comparison Matrix:** [Hyperlink to the comparison matrix .md or .xlsx, if it exists]

## Context

[2-3 sentences. What is this segment, why does it matter, and what question
are we answering. Link back to the parent research file for the full landscape.]

## Background

[Longer treatment than the parent file. History, evolution, how this segment
emerged. Establish the foundation a reader needs to understand what follows.]

## Current State

[What exists today. Key players, market size, adoption levels, maturity.
Include data with Vancouver citations.]

## How It Works

[Mechanics, technical details, or operational model — whatever "how it works"
means for this segment. Diagrams or tables where helpful.]

## Strengths & Opportunities

[Detailed analysis, not just bullet points. Each strength backed by evidence.]

## Weaknesses & Risks

[Honest assessment. What could go wrong. What are the limitations.
Include counterarguments to the strengths above.]

## Case Studies

[2-3 real-world examples of this segment in action.
For each: what happened, what worked, what didn't, what's the takeaway.]

### [Case Study 1: Name]
- **Context:** [Situation]
- **Approach:** [What they did]
- **Outcome:** [Result]
- **Takeaway:** [Lesson for Pocket Space]

### [Case Study 2: Name]
[Same structure]

## Relevance to Pocket Space

[Detailed analysis of how this segment connects to Pocket Space specifically.
Not a one-liner — a genuine assessment of applicability, risks, and next steps
if the team wanted to pursue this direction.]

## Key Takeaways

- [5-8 bullets summarizing the most important findings]

## Open Questions

- [What this deep dive didn't fully answer]
- [What would require further investigation, interviews, or testing]

## References

[Vancouver style — numbered list]
[1] Author. Title. Source. Year. URL.
[2] ...
```

### Step 5: File Placement

Deep-dive files live inside the `Research/` folder of the topic folder, nested under a segment subfolder.

- If a topic folder structure exists (`[Topic_of_Research]/Research/`), place the deep dive inside a segment subfolder:
  ```
  [Topic_of_Research]/
  ├── [Topic_of_Research].docx          ← Added later by research-synthesizer
  └── Research/
      ├── README.md
      ├── Landscape_Research.md          ← Parent research file
      ├── [Segment_A]/                   ← Segment subfolder for this deep dive
      │   └── [Segment_A]_Deep_Dive.md   ← This file goes here
      ├── [Segment_B]/
      │   └── [Segment_B]_Deep_Dive.md
      └── ...
  ```
- If no topic folder exists yet, create the structure:
  ```
  [Department_Folder]/
  └── [Topic_of_Research]/
      └── Research/
          ├── README.md
          └── [Segment_Name]/
              └── [Segment_Name]_Deep_Dive.md
  ```
- Segment subfolders can themselves be deeply nested if the deep dive spawns further sub-research
- Name: `[Segment_Name]_Deep_Dive.md`
- Follow naming conventions: underscores, descriptive name
- Follow author sign-off rules from contribution guidelines
- Update the `Research/README.md` to reflect the new file and subfolder

### Step 6: Hyperlinks

The finished document must include:
1. **Link to parent research file** — In the header metadata and in the Context section, hyperlink to the .md file from research-md-maker that this deep dive expands on (use relative path within the `Research/` folder)
2. **Link to comparison matrix** — If a comparison matrix (`.md` or `.xlsx`) exists from the analyzer, hyperlink to it in the header metadata
3. **Links to sibling deep dives** — If other segments from the same parent file have also been deep-dived, cross-link to those documents within neighboring segment subfolders
4. **Update the parent file** — Add a note in the parent research .md under the relevant segment: `See also: [Segment_Deep_Dive.md](link)` pointing to this new document

## Sources & Citations (Vancouver Style)

Use **Vancouver citation style** — numbered references in order of first appearance.

**Inline:** Use bracketed numbers where a claim is made.
- Example: `Token-gated communities saw 3x higher retention than open-access alternatives [1], with the strongest effects in groups under 150 members [2].`

**Rules:**
- Every factual claim, statistic, or finding must have a numbered citation
- Numbers assigned in order of first appearance
- Unsourced findings must be marked `[Author's analysis]`
- Prefer primary sources over secondhand summaries
- Include URLs for all web-accessible sources

## Writing Style

Unlike research-md-maker (which is parsimonious), deep-dive documents are **thorough**:
- Longer paragraphs are acceptable when building an argument
- Include context and explanation, not just conclusions
- Use data and examples to support points
- Still no filler — every paragraph should advance understanding
- Maintain a professional, analytical tone
