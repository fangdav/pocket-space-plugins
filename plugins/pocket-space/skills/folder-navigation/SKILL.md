# Pocket Space Folder Map

Pocket Space is a SocialFi web app facilitating real-life interactions where people can create clubs for IRL meetings using bonding curve mechanics.

## Top-Level Structure

```
Pocket Space/
├── _Active/          — Current working documents (start here)
├── _Archive/         — Historical documents from previous pivots
├── _Meeting_Notes/   — Chronological team meeting notes (YYYY-MM subfolders)
├── Plugins/          — Plugins and integrations
└── README.md
```

## _Active/ — Where All Current Work Lives

Organized by department:

### Product/
Core product planning and design work.
- `Design/` — User flows, screen mockups, UI inventory
- `General_Research/` — Market analysis, competitive research, bonding curve mechanics
- `Brainstorming/` — Open questions, roadmap, ideation, future features

### Finance/

### Operations/

## Research Topic Folder Pattern

When research leads to a .docx deliverable, everything lives in a self-contained topic folder:

```
[Department_Folder]/
└── [Topic_of_Research]/                  ← Topic folder
    ├── [Topic_of_Research].docx          ← Final deliverable
    └── Research/                          ← All source .md files
        ├── README.md
        ├── Landscape_Research.md
        ├── Comparison_Matrix.md
        ├── Segment_A/                     ← Deeply nested by segment
        │   ├── Segment_A_Deep_Dive.md
        │   └── Sub_Topic/
        │       └── Sub_Topic_Research.md
        └── Segment_B/
            └── Segment_B_Deep_Dive.md
```

This pattern applies anywhere a .docx is produced. The topic folder goes inside the relevant department folder.
